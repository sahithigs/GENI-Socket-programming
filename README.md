# GENI-Socket-programming
Developing and deploying a simple TCP client and server programs on GENI (refer GENI LabZero slide and sample socket programs). Showing the screenshots of simple message exchanges.

Developing a simple chat program (similar to google hangout and skype chat), and showing the screenshots of the execution of the below. Extending the first program to chat client-server program following these steps. 

A chat server will accept a single client connection and display everything the client types. If the client user types ‘quit’, both client and server will end the program.	A server now remains ‘open’ for additional connection once a client quits. The server can handle at most one connection at a time
